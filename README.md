# Portfolio
<strong> This project is my own personal portfolio, it is coded using HTML, Bootstrap4 and JavaScript and offers direct link to both the code and live version (or documentation) of projects I led. </strong>

I am a French engineer living in Finland.

I have two years of professional experience in the Smart-Industries field as a technical consultant working in automation, HMI/SCADA design, machine vision and industrial computing in general.

Though my scholarship, I also grew decent skills in the back-end languages and an interest for the software development. I am investing my free-time working through the OpenClassrooms Front-End Developer path to get a more professional and versatile developer skillset.
